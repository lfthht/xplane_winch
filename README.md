X-Plane plugin to simulate a winch for multiplayer

This is a very basic glider winch script for multiplayer ( since the xplane winch does not work in MP). It is not as good as the standard xplane winch function but it helps you to get in to the air.  You need the xplane pyhton interface to use it.
